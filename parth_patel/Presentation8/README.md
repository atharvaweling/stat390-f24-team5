****Multistain Image Classification****

*Purpose:* <br>
Multichannel CNN used on small sample dataset of patches. 3 channels for each 3 stains, leading to 3x3 = 9 total channels for combined patch.
<br>

*Steps:*
1. Run the pipeline code to make patches across stains
2. Selected few patient level patches (meaning a patch folder with all 3 stains) and moved to folder patches_selected (done because patching is not perfect)
3. Open severity_labels.py and add severity label to patient_severity dictionary. Run creating severity_labels.csv
4. Open mod_con.py and adjust patches_dir to directory leading to the patches_selected folder. The folder is shown below.
5. Results should be generated.
