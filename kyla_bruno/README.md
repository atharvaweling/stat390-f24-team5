## Week 4 Directory Notes
The scripts are written with reference to the directory I have set up on my laptop, which does not have a separate results and scripts folder. Instead, the ``__pycache__ folder``, the 3 ``.py`` scripts, the ``Sheffiled_Samples`` folder, and ``similarity_results.txt`` are all in a folder called ``workspace``, in which a virtual environment was created. 

Also note that my version of the Sheffield_Samples folder has a subfolder called ``has_multiple`` with the specific patients used in this week's work. This may be different than the exact structure of the ``Sheffield_Samples`` folder uploaded/used by my group members.
